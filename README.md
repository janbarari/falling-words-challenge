## Falling Words Game Challenge by Babbel
A mini word game to learn spanish provided by Babel as coding challenge. 

### Stack
- Kotlin
- Coroutines
- Jetpack Compose
- Hilt
- Decoupled MVI architecture
- Clean architecture

### Why Decoupled MVI Architecture?
Here is an article that I introduced decoupled MVI architecture
[Decoupled MVI Architecture](https://betterprogramming.pub/introducing-decoupled-mvi-approach-for-android-in-2023-b93e4a16fb1b?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------)

### Time Limit
As it requested to be less than 4-8 hours, It took around 12 hours of work.

### What would do differently if I had more time?
Since I already exceed the task requested time, I would work/add:
- Unit and UI tests
- Modularization
- Better UX
